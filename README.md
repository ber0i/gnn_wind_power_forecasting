# Physics-Induced Graph Neural Network for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of Wind Power

In this project, we develop physics-induced graph neural networks for spatio-temporal, probabilistic wind power forecasting. The newly developed methods will be benchmarked against other state-of-the-art forecasting models. For details on the research plan, you can find a written research proposal [here](https://github.com/ber0i/gnn_wind_power_forecasting/research_plan/research_proposal.pdf).

## Data

The dataset used here is 10min Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) data from the six wind turbines at the Kelmarsh wind farm [[1]](#1).

## Acknowledgment

We appreciate the following GitHub repository for its publicly available code and methods, which we use as benchmark methods for our architecture:
